                    <li>Song requests are welcome, but not all songs can be licensed</li>
                    <li>We will discuss music options during our planning process</li>
                    <li>If a specific song cannot be licensed, we will suggest suitable alternatives</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Copyright and Usage Rights</h2>
                <p>Intellectual property rights:</p>
